## Writing Articles

1. Go to `yoursite.com/admin/`
2. Log in with your invited identity
3. Click "Articles" → "New Article"
4. Write using the rich text editor, upload images
5. Click "Publish"

Note: After publishing, you'll need to manually update `articles/index.json` for the homepage listing until a build step is added. Alternatively, consider adding a static site generator (Eleventy/Hugo) later for automatic article page generation.
